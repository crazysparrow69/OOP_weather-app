# OOP_weather-app

This is a simple weather web-application made using OOP. It works with open API, shows weather for the moment and forecast for the next couple of days. Though it could seem to have small functional, but a big functional was not a goal for this project. I learnt on practice how to create a full app with OOP on JavaScript and how to structure it. Also used pattern Singleton.
